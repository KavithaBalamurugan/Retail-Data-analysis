A centralised Kafka server has been set up where the data will be hosted. The details of the Kafka server, such as the broker and topic, will be shared to you in the next segment.

 

The data is based on an Online Retail Data Set in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Each order’s invoice has been represented in a JSON format. The sample data looks like this.

 

{
  "invoice_no": 154132541653705,
  "country": "United Kingdom",
  "timestamp": "2020-09-18 10:55:23",
  "type": "ORDER",
  "items": [
    {
      "SKU": "21485",
      "title": "RETROSPOT HEART HOT WATER BOTTLE",
      "unit_price": 4.95,
      "quantity": 6
    },
    {
      "SKU": "23499",
      "title": "SET 12 VINTAGE DOILY CHALK",
      "unit_price": 0.42,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]  
}
 

 

As you can see, the data contains the following information:

Invoice number: Identifier of the invoice

Country: Country where the order is placed

Timestamp: Time at which the order is placed

Type: Whether this is a new order or a return order

SKU (Stock Keeping Unit): Identifier of the product being ordered

Title: Name of the product is ordered

Unit price: Price of a single unit of the product

Quantity: Quantity of the product being ordered

You will be using these columns to derive some additional columns as well, which will help you in calculating the KPIs. You will learn more about this in the next segment.
